Analysis of weather trends across global latitudes

It is currently winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and the tilt of the axis puts the latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere towards the sun and thus it is warmer at this time of year. As one travel towards the equator, the temperature trends warmer. An outlier of the trend, Roebourne, Australia, is particularly hot this time of year at 40.66C (105F) and is at twenty degrees away from the equator. 

There are no strong trends among the other weather features analyzed. Comparing humidity against Latitudes shows no relation, although a majority of the cities sampled have greater than 60% humidity levels.

Comparing cloud cover across latitudes produce no correlation either, though there are clusters of cities with 0, 75, and 90% cloud covers.

A comparison of wind speed across latitudes has no strong correlations either. A majority of cities sampled are enjoying a leisurely wind speed right around 3mph.
